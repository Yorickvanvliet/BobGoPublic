Public repo for the XR hackathon entry Bob Go!

Bob Go! is a small game with a focus on voice controls. In the game you have to guide Bob the robot to his destination. Unfortunately Bob isn't too smart and will only go in a straight line and possibly into a laser. To make matters worse, Bob wil go as soon as he hears either the word "Move" or "Go"

Luckily there are other robots that can help Bob make it to his destination safely. They are called Steve and Jim.
With intelligent voice controls you can guide Steve and Jim to help Bob out.

For example: 
- You can tell Steve to "pick up the blue block" which is in Bob's way. 
- You can tell Jim to "push the second block down". This will make Jim move to the second block and push it down.

The level can be positioned in your play space to work best with the passthrough environment. For example you can place the level on your kitchen table.
Choose between passthrough and immersive mode to best suit your needs.
