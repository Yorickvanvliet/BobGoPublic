public repo for the XR hackathon entry Bob Go!

Bob Go! is a small game with a focus on voice controls. In the game you have to guide Bob the robot to his destination. To make Bob move you have to say "Bob go!" Unfortunately Bob isn't too smart and will only go in a straight line and possibly into a laser.

Luckily there are other robots that can help Bob make it to his destination safely. These are called Steve and Jim.

With intelligent voice controls you can guide the other robots to help Bob out. Controls that would otherwise need a pointing device like a mouse or touchscreen.

For example: 
you can tell steve to "pick up the blue block" which is in Bob's way. 
you can tell Jim to "push the block down". This will make Jim move to the square above the block and push it up.

The level can be positioned in your play space to work best with the passthrough environment. For example you can place the level on your kitchen table.
